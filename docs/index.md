# μAdmin for Looker

μAdmin for Looker, or μAdmin for short, allows the owner of a [Looker](https://looker.com/) instance to easily define administrative flows and selectively expose those flows to end users. Once μAdmin has been deployed, non-administrative end users will be able to execute allowlisted administrative flows with highly granular access controls and logging.

μAdmin includes both (1) a library of pre-written administrative flows, and (2) a framework for writing new administrative flows with minimal development overhead.
