# Configuration

## Configuration Example

See [`server/config.example.json`](../server/config.example.json)

## Configuration Reference

<ul>
<li><code>server/config.json</code>
	<ul>
	<li><details><summary><code>callbackUrlPrefix</code></summary>
	Required. A URL prefix for the callback URL used in the Looker OAuth process. `/login-popup` will be added to the prefix to form the full callback URL. Example values might be `http://localhost:3000` for development or `https://micro-admin-for-looker.mydomain.com` for production.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>corsOrigin</code></summary>
	Optional. A string containing an origin, or an array of strings containing origins, from which the server should accept CORS requests, if any. In the default configuration of `serveUi`, CORS is not needed since the UI is served from the same origin as the API server. For additional details about accepted arguments see [the `cors` package on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuration-options)
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>oauthClientAppGuid</code></summary>
	Optional, default "micro-admin-for-looker". A string that identifies this application within Looker's OAuth apps registry. You should normally not change this setting unless you are trying to connect multiple deployments of Î¼Admin to the same Looker instance.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>port</code></summary>
	Required. A number for the port that the server will listen on. (Currently only http, not https, is provided. Add an SSL termination load balancer for https/production use)
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>primaryHostId</code></summary>
	Required. A "host id" string that matches one of the entries in the hosts object. All flows that do not specify a different host will operate against this primary host by default, and this host will be exposed via the singular version of the `host` argument in flows.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>serveUi</code></summary>
	Optional, default true. Whether the server should also serve the default static UI. You may want to use change flag when deploying static UI assets to a CDN instead.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>flows</code></summary>
	Required. An object, where each entry represents one flow. Each entry's key should match the filename of a file in the server/flows directory
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>flows.*.label</code></summary>
	Optional. Overrides the label displayed to the user
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>flows.*.description</code></summary>
	Optional. Overrides the description displayed to the user.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>flows.*.disabled</code></summary>
	Optional. Set to true to disable the flow while still keeping the entry in the config.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>flows.*.requiredGroups</code></summary>
	Required. An array containing zero or more Looker Group IDs that the user must belong to to invoke this flow.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>hosts</code></summary>
	Required. An object, where each entry represents one Looker instance and the key value becomes its ID. Often there will only be one entry.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>hosts.*.apiHost</code></summary>
	Required. An HTTP host (domain + optional port) where API requests should be directed. For customers on Looker's AWS infrastructure, this is often `my-company.looker.com:19999`. For customers on Looker's GCP infrastructure, this is the same as your uiHost, usually `my-company.cloud.looker.com`. Do not specify a scheme/protocol - only HTTPS is supported.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>hosts.*.uiHost</code></summary>
	Required. An HTTP host (domain + optional port) where UI requests should be directed (i.e. the OAuth credentials screen). For customers on Looker's AWS infrastructure, this is often `my-company.looker.com`. For customers on Looker's GCP infrastructure, this is the same as your apiHost, usually `my-company.cloud.looker.com`. Do not specify a scheme/protocol - only HTTPS is supported.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>hosts.*.apiCredentials</code></summary>
	Required. An object containing a `client_id` and `client_secret` from a Looker API credential to use as the service account.
	</details>
	</li>
	<li><details><summary><code>hosts.*.oauthClientAppGuid</code></summary>
	Optional. A host-specific override for `oauthClientAppGuid`.
	</details>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ui/static/config.js</code>
	<ul>
	<li><details><summary><code>apiPrefix</code></summary>
	Required. A URL prefix for API calls. A blank string will cause API calls to be sent to the UI's origin, which works when the server is configured with serveUi:true
	</details>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
